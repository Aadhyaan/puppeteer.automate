The Puppeteer Website Automation project showcases the usage of the Puppeteer library to automate user actions on a website. With this project, you can easily automate tasks on any website. The project provides a basic template that launches a headful browser, navigates to the swap.defillama.com website, and fills in a form.

The form inputs include the chain name, the amount to sell, and the tokens to select for selling and buying. Once the form is filled, the script selects the second option from the "Select a route to perform a swap" section. The automation is achieved by leveraging the Puppeteer library's functionalities to interact with the website's elements and simulate user actions. To use the project, you need to have Node.js installed on your system and follow a few simple steps. 
The README.md file provides detailed instructions on how to clone the repository, install dependencies, and run the automation script. Additionally, it offers guidance on customizing the automation for different websites by modifying the URL, form field values, and route selection.
